# CTF Platform Fix Todo

## Phase 2: Identify and fix admin panel authentication issues

### Issues Identified:
1. ❌ Admin panel shows for 1 second then disappears with "data breach" message
2. ❌ Admin authentication flow is broken
3. ❌ Session management issues between frontend and backend

### Analysis:
- Frontend AdminLogin component calls `/api/admin/login` endpoint
- AdminPanelCTF component calls `/api/admin_auth.php` for session check
- There's a mismatch between login endpoint and session check endpoint
- Backend has both PHP and Python endpoints which may be conflicting
